          <h3>OUR STORY</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
          <p>On 4th January 2015, I came to the realisation that the only way to save money, without actually accessing my accumulated funds, was to buy a ceramic pot and then to smash it to pieces once I had reached my target date.  After one cut finger and a kitchen table full of debris, I contacted my brother, Adam, to discuss a solution to this problem.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
          <p>We spent the next 3 weeks searching the internet for money boxes with a time delay locking device as well as trawling through pages and pages of current patents that had been filed, just so we were sure not to copy an existing design.  We then conducted research in relation to the need of willpower to meet saving goals and, according to the studies, there are two types of people, “Savers” and “Non-Savers”.   Research complete, we decided we needed to assemble a dream team to move forward, and luckily we were able to secure the involvement of Rhys and Will.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
          <p>After the initial idea was in place, the function was set so that once a time-scale/date had been installed into the money box, a motor would drive the locking pin into an allocated slot and it would remain in that position until said time-scale/date had been reached.  This resulted in the accumulated funds being inaccessible for the set period of time, with no override!  Having no electronic experience, we set out to find a designer that could help bring our idea to life and this is where we introduce Cubik Innovation.  Cubik is a really great company that work closely with entrepreneurs to develop ideas into working prototypes.  We signed off the project and both parties were really excited about the idea and work began.  However, the cost for a working prototype was a little over our budget (made up of our collective personal savings), therefore mission “we need money” commenced.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
          <p>After being rejected by numerous banks for business loans, we turned our attention to grants.  After countless hours of searching and filing applications, we came across Innovate UK.  We were granted £5,000 to kick off our project.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
          <p>With our savings and granted money in hand, we continued with our mission to help people who were having the same problem with saving money as us. Subsequently, The Time Key was born.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
          <p class="bottom">As we are now nearing the final stages of our prototype, we are calling all non-savers to help turn our idea into a reality.  We need your backing via crowd-funding to help generate presales so we can bring The Time Key to the market.
